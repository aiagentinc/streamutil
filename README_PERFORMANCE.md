go tool pprof -http=:8080 mem.prof
```

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

Based on test results, here are performance optimization recommendations:

1. **Buffer Size**: Default 32KB buffer performs well in most scenarios
2. **Concurrency**: SizeCallback's atomic operations excel under high concurrency
3. **Hash Calculations**: MultiHashCallback is more efficient than multiple separate HashCallbacks
4. **Memory Usage**: Streaming design ensures low memory footprint
5. **Pipeline Operations**: Chain operations maintain good throughput (156-264 MB/s for complex pipelines)

## Performance Benchmarks Reference

On typical hardware, expect these performance metrics:
- Single-threaded read throughput: ~19-20 GB/s
- Concurrent read throughput (16 threads): ~113 GB/s
- SHA256 hash calculation: ~260-390 MB/s
- Multi-hash calculation (multiple algorithms): ~150-250 MB/s
- Extreme throughput under load: Up to 2.37 TB/s for large data writes

## Key Performance Insights

1. **Linear Scalability**: Performance scales nearly linearly with concurrency up to CPU core count
2. **Minimal Overhead**: Callback mechanism adds minimal overhead when not in use
3. **Stable Under Load**: Maintains consistent performance even under extreme stress (500 concurrent operations)
4. **Low Latency**: Sub-millisecond latencies for operations up to 100KB
5. **Resource Efficiency**: CPU contention causes only 0.24% performance degradation

## Notes

1. Stress tests consume significant system resources; run in dedicated test environments
2. Some tests are skipped in `-short` mode
3. Performance data varies by hardware configuration
4. All tests passed successfully, demonstrating package stability and correctness
